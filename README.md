## About

Airbnb is being sued by the city of Paris for "illegally" listing 1,010 apartments on their site, the fine could be as high as €12.6 million (€12,500 per listing). Much like New York City, Paris has very strict laws on how tenants can handle short term rentals, however, shouldn't the tenants be fined instead of Airbnb?  There are currently 13 cities that are attempting to tighten the law around short term rentals however, I personally disagree with the idea that corporations will be getting fined rather than the hosts. This is how many law systems function today for example, if someone steals a laptop from a coffee shop the individual faces the consequences and not the establishment.

Airbnb has been a useful tool that lowers the cost of traveling experience and to punish it for the actions of its hosts will increase prices and will not stop tenants from continuing to illegally rent out their homes, as they could easily go to another platform.
